# Loxberry Plugin Link2Home

This plugin is currently under development.

This repository contains a plugin for the Loxberry to enable remote control of Link2Home sockets via UDP, allowing users to switch specified relays on or off based on command-line inputs.
The plugin read configuration details from an INI file and send a hex-encoded UDP command to the specified IP and port for an specified mac address. The scripts only trigger the link2home garden socket outlet (WiFi version).
